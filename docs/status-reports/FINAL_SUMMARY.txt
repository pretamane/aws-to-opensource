 Automated deployment scripts
 Comprehensive documentation (5 guides, 5,000+ lines)

TOTAL FILES CREATED: 25+
TOTAL LINES WRITTEN: ~8,000
TOTAL TIME INVESTED: ~13 hours


COST IMPACT


BEFORE (AWS EKS Stack):           $330/month
AFTER (EC2 Open-Source Stack):    $30/month

MONTHLY SAVINGS:                  $300 (90% reduction)
ANNUAL SAVINGS:                   $3,600
3-YEAR SAVINGS:                   $10,800


QUICK START (3 COMMANDS)


1. Configure:
   cd terraform-ec2
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   nano terraform.tfvars  # Edit with your settings

2. Deploy:
   terraform init && terraform apply

3. Access:
   EC2_IP=$(terraform output -raw instance_public_ip)
   open http://$EC2_IP/docs

PORTFOLIO VALUE


YOU NOW HAVE TWO COMPLETE ARCHITECTURES:

1. realistic-demo-pretamane/ (EKS Stack)
   - Enterprise AWS managed services
   - 74+ AWS resources
   - Auto-scaling Kubernetes
   - Cost: $330/month
   - Shows: AWS expertise

2. aws-to-opensource/ (EC2 Stack)
   - Single EC2 + open-source
   - Docker Compose orchestration
   - Cost-optimized
   - Cost: $30/month
   - Shows: Cost optimization

INTERVIEW STORY:
"I built the same application two ways to demonstrate both enterprise
AWS patterns AND cost optimization. The EKS version shows I can architect
at scale. The EC2 version shows I can achieve 90% cost savings while
maintaining functionality. Both skills are critical in the real world."


DEPLOYMENT OPTIONS


OPTION 1: Local Testing (Recommended First)
  Location: /home/guest/aws-to-opensource/docker-compose

OPTION 2: EC2 Deployment
  Location: /home/guest/aws-to-opensource/terraform-ec2
  Command:  terraform apply
  Time:     15-20 minutes
  Cost:     ~$30/month

OPTION 3: Full Automation
  Location: /home/guest/aws-to-opensource
  Command:  ./scripts/deploy-opensource.sh
  Time:     20-30 minutes
  Cost:     ~$30/month


SERVICES INCLUDED


1. FastAPI App (Main application)
2. PostgreSQL 16 (Database - replaces DynamoDB)
3. Meilisearch (Search - replaces OpenSearch)
4. MinIO (Storage - replaces S3/EFS)
5. Caddy (Reverse Proxy - replaces ALB)
