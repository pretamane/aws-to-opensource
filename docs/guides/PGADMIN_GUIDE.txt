 TROUBLESHOOTING


Q: I don't see "Servers" in the left sidebar
A: Refresh the page (F5). If still not there, you need to add a server.

Q: Server connection failed
A: Make sure you typed "postgresql" (not "localhost" or IP address)

Q: Authentication failed
A: Double-check the password (copy-paste from above)

Q: I see the tables but they're empty
A: Your data is there! Try running a SQL query to confirm:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contact_submissions;
