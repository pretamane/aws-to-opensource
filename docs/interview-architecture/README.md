# Interview Architecture Playbook

This folder distills the entire `aws-to-opensource` repository into interview-ready notes. Each file isolates a different view of the platform so you can learn, retain, and present the architecture with confidence.

## File Map

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `01-architecture-map.md` | High-level system map with component overview |
| `02-layers.md` | Breakdown of every technology layer and its responsibilities |
| `03-services.md` | Deep dive on each running service, dependencies, and configs |
| `04-flows.md` | Step-by-step data, monitoring, and deployment flows |
| `05-tooling-and-automation.md` | Infrastructure, automation, and supporting tooling |
| `06-interview-cheatsheet.md` | Quick-reference talking points and sample answers |

## How to Use

1. **Start with the architecture map** to refresh the big picture.
2. **Review the layer breakdown** to understand which tool lives where.
3. **Skim individual services** to rehearse precise responsibilities and dependencies.
4. **Walk through the flows** to practice storytelling with real scenarios.
5. **Rehearse with the cheat sheet** right before your interview.

Use these notes together with the existing `docs/interview-prep` folder when you want a deeper dive.
