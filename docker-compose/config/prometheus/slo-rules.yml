# ============================================================================
# USAGE NOTES
# ============================================================================
# 
# To query SLO metrics in Grafana:
# 
# Availability:
#   - slo:availability:ratio * 100  (should be > 99.5)
#   - slo:error_rate:ratio * 100    (should be < 0.5)
# 
# Latency:
#   - slo:latency:p95  (should be < 1.0)
#   - slo:latency:p99  (should be < 3.0)
# 
# Error Budget Remaining (approximate):
#   - 1 - (increase(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[30d]) / increase(http_requests_total[30d])) / 0.005
#   - Result of 1.0 = 100% budget remaining
#   - Result of 0.0 = budget exhausted
